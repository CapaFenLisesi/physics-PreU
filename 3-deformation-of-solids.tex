\chapter{Deformation of Solids}
\section*{Content}
\begin{itemize}
\item elastic and plastic behaviour
\item stress and strain
\end{itemize}

\section*{Candidates should be able to:}
\spec{distinguish between elastic and plastic deformation of a material}

\spec{recall the terms brittle, ductile, hard, malleable, stiff, strong and tough, explain their meaning and give examples of materials exhibiting such behaviour}

\spec{explain the meaning of, use and calculate tensile/compressive stress, tensile/compressive strain, spring constant, strength, breaking stress, stiffness and Young modulus}

\spec{draw force-extension, force-compression and tensile/compressive stress-strain graphs, and explain the meaning of the limit of proportionality, elastic limit, yield point, breaking force and breaking stress}

\spec{state Hookeâ€™s law and identify situations in which it is obeyed}

\spec{account for the stress-strain graphs of metals and polymers in terms of the microstructure of the material.}
